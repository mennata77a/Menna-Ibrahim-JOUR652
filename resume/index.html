  <p class="description"> I collaborated with the communication team to expand United Way’s digital and social media
presence across multiple platforms. I also created content for a variety of audiences, including
internal and external network partners, donors, and more. I also utilized User Experience (UX)

sponsors, and volunteers throughout the DMV area. I also spearheaded the digital component of
our 30-day GivingTuesday campaign urging folks to donate to our organization.</p>
