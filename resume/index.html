    <strong >Student and Journalist</strong>

ultimate goal of amplifying the voices of marginalized people in the media.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Outreach and Recruitment Management Analyst</h3>
    <h4>Food and Drug Administration</h4>
    <h5>June 2019 - Present</h5>
    <p> I manage a database for hiring managers to better sift through intern and volunteer applications. I
also write and report for our bi-monthly newsletter, The Connector. Similarly, I create and curate
internal and external messages, as well as standard operating procedures and content calendars,
to boost our engagement on LinkedIn and Twitter. On LinkedIn, I run and develop posts for an
FDA-affiliated page, the FDA Recruitment Network. Relavent Link: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/fda-recruitment-network/">https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/fda-recruitment-network.</a></p>

  <h3>Community Engagement Intern</h3>
  <h4>Holy Cross Health, Health Equity Center</h4>
  <h5>January 2022 - May 2022</h5>
  <p> I supported the development of programs that addressed health crises like diabetes, various
cancers, food insecurity, and the COVID-19 pandemic. I also assisted in the coordination of
community health events and funding grants. I created health education brochures, display
boards, and models, as well as collaborated with local high schools and educational programs in
Montgomery County, Maryland to facilitate the development of school-based fairs in the fall.</p>

  <h3>Diverse Voices in Science Journalism Intern</h3>
  <h4>Science Magazine</h4>
  <h5>May 2021 - August 2021</h5>
  <p> I reported and wrote for Science’s daily online news site, weekly print magazine, and various
digital media products. I covered science-related events in and around DC, including
conferences, briefings, congressional hearings, and more. In addition to interviewing the world’s
top scientists and researchers, I synthesized technical, scientific jargon into digestible, accessible
content for a lay audience. Relavent Link: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/author/mennatalla-ibrahim">https://www.science.org/content/author/mennatalla-ibrahim.</a></p>

  <h3>Health Promotion and Wellness Peer Educator</h3>
  <h4>University of Maryland Health Center</h4>
  <h5>August 2020 - May 2021</h5>
  <p> I led workshops and presentations about maintaining wellness during the pandemic to classrooms
of first-year undergraduates and several UMD organizations. I also facilitated outreach efforts
and utilized social media to support the university health center’s various programs.
Furthermore, I conducted research and developed two university-level programs on the schoolto-prison pipeline and the criminalization of cannabis.</p>

  <h3>Strategic Communication, Content, and Analytics Intern</h3>
  <h4>United Way Worldwide</h4>
  <h5>May 2020 - August 2020</h5>
  <p> I collaborated with the communication team to expand United Way’s digital and social media
presence across multiple platforms. I also created content for a variety of audiences, including
internal and external network partners, donors, and more. I also utilized User Experience (UX)
data to measure and analyze our digital content performance. Based on that data, as well as the
information I learned from an internal audit, I proposed changes to the existing website in
collaboration with our international offices.</p>

  <h3>Marketing, Social Media, Public Relations Intern</h3>
  <h4>Playworks DC</h4>
  <h5>September 2018 - December 2018</h5>
  <p> I created websites, newsletters, videos, and social media content highlighting upcoming events
and our overall mission. I revitalized existing social media platforms, specifically Instagram and
Twitter, and created digestible content to improve our visibility to educational organizations and
nonprofits. Both in person and virtually, I contacted and networked with potential funders,
sponsors, and volunteers throughout the DMV area. I also spearheaded the digital component of
our 30-day GivingTuesday campaign urging folks to donate to our organization.</p>
